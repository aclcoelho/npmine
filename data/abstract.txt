The integration of LC−MS/MS molecular networking and in silico MS/MS fragmentation is an emerging method for dereplication of natural products. In the present study, a targeted isolation of natural products using a new in silico-based annotation tool named Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) is described. NAP improves accuracy of in silico fragmentation analyses by reranking candidate structures based on the network topology from MS/MS-based molecular networking. Annotation for the MS/MS spectral network of the Sageratia theezans twig extract was performed using NAP, and most molecular families within the network, including the known triterpenoids 1−7, could be putatively annotated, without relying on any previous reports of molecules from this species. Based on the in silico dereplication results, molecules were prioritized for isolation. In total, six dicoumaroyl 8-O-4′ neolignans (8−13) and three dicoumaroyl lignans (14−16) were isolated from the twigs of S. theezans and structurally characterized by spectroscopic analyses. Isolates were evaluated for their neuroprotective activity, and compounds 14−16 showed potent protective eﬀects against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in mouse HT22 cells at a concentration of 12.5 μM.
